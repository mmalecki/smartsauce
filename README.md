Install all of my shit on a "Smart"OS zone.

Because, clearly, I need this now.

Maybe it's because writing a package manager that doesn't shit on its **ENTIRE**
`--prefix` when you try upgrading it is too fucking hard.

Maybe it's because having a package manager that doesn't require you to edit
2 (two) miserable one-line files in order to update its database is unimaginable.

Maybe it's because fuck computers.

Hold my beer, will ya?
